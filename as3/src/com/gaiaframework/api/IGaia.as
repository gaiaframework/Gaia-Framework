		 * goto is the primary method you will be using in Gaia. It requires at least one argument and that is a string of the branch you want to navigate to.

		 * The optional second argument is for overriding the flow for the goto event. Use the flow constants for these: Gaia.NORMAL, Gaia.PRELOAD, and Gaia.REVERSE. Gaia will use that and ignore the page's flow type as well as the site's default flow. <strong>This feature is primarily used for testing during development only.</strong> If you pass a flow, and then use the browser to navigate back and forward, the passed flow will not be used again because SWFAddress is what is calling goto then, not your original goto. For production, you should set the flow on the page either through <code>site.xml</code> or at runtime.
