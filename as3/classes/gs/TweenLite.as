VERSION: 9.3
DATE: 12/17/2008
ACTIONSCRIPT VERSION: 3.0 (AS2 version is also available)
UPDATES & MORE DETAILED DOCUMENTATION AT: http://www.TweenLite.com
DESCRIPTION:
	Tweening. We all do it. Most of us have learned to avoid Adobe's Tween class in favor of a more powerful engine
	that requires less code (e.g. Tweener). Each has its own strengths & weaknesses. A few years back, 
	I created TweenLite because I needed a very compact tweening engine that was fast and efficient (I couldn't 
	afford the file size bloat that came with the other tweening engines). It quickly became integral to my work 
	flow. I figured others might be able to benefit from it, so I released it publicly. Over the past few years, 
	TweenLite has grown more popular than I could have imagined.

	Since then, I've added new capabilities while trying to keep file size way down (3K). TweenFilterLite extends 
	TweenLite and adds the ability to tween filters including ColorMatrixFilter effects like saturation, contrast, 
	brightness, hue, and even colorization but it only adds about 3k to the file size. Same syntax as TweenLite. 
	There are AS2 and AS3 versions of both of the classes ready for download. TweenMax adds even more features to 
	TweenFilterLite including bezier tweening, pause/resume, sequencing, and much more. (see www.TweenMax.com)

	I know what you're thinking - "if it's so 'lightweight', it's probably missing a lot of features which makes 
	me nervous about using it as my main tweening engine." It is true that it doesn't have the same feature set 
	as some other tweening engines, but I can honestly say that after using it on almost every project I've worked 
	on over the last few years (many award-winning flash apps for fortune-500 companies), it has never let me down. 
	I never found myself needing some other functionality. You can tween any property (including a DisplayObject's 
	volume and color), use any easing function, build in delays, callback functions, pass arguments to that 
	callback function, and even tween arrays all with one line of code. If you need more features, you can always 
	step up to TweenFilterLite or TweenMax.

	I haven't been able to find a faster tween engine either. See an interactive speed comparison 
	of various tweening engines at http://blog.greensock.com/tweeing-speed-test/.

ARGUMENTS:
	1) $target : Object - Target MovieClip (or any other object) whose properties we're tweening
	2) $duration : Number - Duration (in seconds) of the effect
	3) $vars : Object - An object containing the end values of all the properties you'd like to have tweened (or if you're using the 
	         			TweenLite.from() method, these variables would define the BEGINNING values). For example:
							  alpha: The alpha (opacity level) that the target object should finish at (or begin at if you're 
									 using TweenLite.from()). For example, if the target.alpha is 1 when this script is 
									 called, and you specify this argument to be 0.5, it'll transition from 1 to 0.5.
							  x: To change a MovieClip's x position, just set this to the value you'd like the MovieClip to 
								 end up at (or begin at if you're using TweenLite.from()). 
		  SPECIAL PROPERTIES (**OPTIONAL**):
		  	  delay : Number - Amount of delay before the tween should begin (in seconds).
			  ease : Function - You can specify a function to use for the easing with this variable. For example, 
								gs.easing.Elastic.easeOut. The Default is Regular.easeOut.
			  easeParams : Array - An array of extra parameters to feed the easing equation. This can be useful when you 
								   use an equation like Elastic and want to control extra parameters like the amplitude and period.
								   Most easing equations, however, don't require extra parameters so you won't need to pass in any easeParams.
			  autoAlpha : Number - Use it instead of the alpha property to gain the additional feature of toggling 
			  					   the visible property to false when alpha reaches 0. It will also toggle visible 
								   to true before the tween starts if the value of autoAlpha is greater than zero.
			  visible : Boolean - To set a DisplayObject's "visible" property at the end of the tween, use this special property.
			  volume : Number - Tweens the volume of an object with a soundTransform property (MovieClip/SoundChannel/NetStream, etc.)
			  tint : Number - To change a DisplayObject's tint/color, set this to the hex value of the tint you'd like
							  to end up at(or begin at if you're using TweenLite.from()). An example hex value would be 0xFF0000. 
			  removeTint : Boolean - If you'd like to remove the tint that's applied to a DisplayObject, pass true for this special property.
			  frame : Number - Use this to tween a MovieClip to a particular frame.
			  onStart : Function - If you'd like to call a function as soon as the tween begins, pass in a reference to it here.
								   This is useful for when there's a delay. 
			  onStartParams : Array - An array of parameters to pass the onStart function. (this is optional)
			  onUpdate : Function - If you'd like to call a function every time the property values are updated (on every frame during
									the time the tween is active), pass a reference to it here.
			  onUpdateParams : Array - An array of parameters to pass the onUpdate function (this is optional)
			  onComplete : Function - If you'd like to call a function when the tween has finished, use this. 
			  onCompleteParams : Array - An array of parameters to pass the onComplete function (this is optional)
			  persist : Boolean - if true, the TweenLite instance will NOT automatically be removed by the garbage collector when it is complete.
			  					  However, it is still eligible to be overwritten by new tweens even if persist is true. By default, it is false.
			  renderOnStart : Boolean - If you're using TweenFilterLite.from() with a delay and want to prevent the tween from rendering until it
										actually begins, set this to true. By default, it's false which causes TweenLite.from() to render
										its values immediately, even before the delay has expired.
			  overwrite : int - Controls how other tweens of the same object are handled when this tween is created. Here are the options:
			  					- 0 (NONE): No tweens are overwritten. This is the fastest mode, but you need to be careful not to create any 
			  								tweens with overlapping properties, otherwise they'll conflict with each other. 
											
								- 1 (ALL): (this is the default unless OverwriteManager.init() has been called) All tweens of the same object 
										   are completely overwritten immediately when the tween is created. 
										   		TweenLite.to(mc, 1, {x:100, y:200});
												TweenLite.to(mc, 1, {x:300, delay:2, overwrite:1}); //immediately overwrites the previous tween
												
								- 2 (AUTO): (used by default if OverwriteManager.init() has been called) Searches for and overwrites only 
											individual overlapping properties in tweens that are active when the tween begins. 
												TweenLite.to(mc, 1, {x:100, y:200});
												TweenLite.to(mc, 1, {x:300, overwrite:2}); //only overwrites the "x" property in the previous tween
												
								- 3 (CONCURRENT): Overwrites all tweens of the same object that are active when the tween begins.
												  TweenLite.to(mc, 1, {x:100, y:200});
												  TweenLite.to(mc, 1, {x:300, delay:2, overwrite:3}); //does NOT overwrite the previous tween because the first tween will have finished by the time this one begins.
	

EXAMPLES: 
	As a simple example, you could tween the alpha to 50% (0.5) and move the x position of a MovieClip named "clip_mc" 
	to 120 and fade the volume to 0 over the course of 1.5 seconds like so:
	
		import gs.TweenLite;
		TweenLite.to(clip_mc, 1.5, {alpha:0.5, x:120, volume:0});
	
	If you want to get more advanced and tween the clip_mc MovieClip over 5 seconds, changing the alpha to 0.5, 
	the x to 120 using the "easeOutBack" easing function, delay starting the whole tween by 2 seconds, and then call
	a function named "onFinishTween" when it has completed and pass in a few parameters to that function (a value of
	5 and a reference to the clip_mc), you'd do so like:
		
		import gs.TweenLite;
		import gs.easing.Back;
		TweenLite.to(clip_mc, 5, {alpha:0.5, x:120, ease:Back.easeOut, delay:2, onComplete:onFinishTween, onCompleteParams:[5, clip_mc]});
		function onFinishTween(argument1:Number, argument2:MovieClip):void {
			trace("The tween has finished! argument1 = " + argument1 + ", and argument2 = " + argument2);
		}
	
	If you have a MovieClip on the stage that is already in it's end position and you just want to animate it into 
	place over 5 seconds (drop it into place by changing its y property to 100 pixels higher on the screen and 
	dropping it from there), you could:
		
		import gs.TweenLite;
		import gs.easing.Elastic;
		TweenLite.from(clip_mc, 5, {y:"-100", ease:Elastic.easeOut});		
	

NOTES:
	- This class will add about 3kb to your Flash file.
	- Putting quotes around values will make the tween relative to the current value. For example, if you do
	  TweenLite.to(mc, 2, {x:"-20"}); it'll move the mc.x to the left 20 pixels which is the same as doing
	  TweenLite.to(mc, 2, {x:mc.x - 20});
	- You can change the TweenLite.defaultEase function if you prefer something other than Regular.easeOut.
	- You must target Flash Player 9 or later (ActionScript 3.0)
	- You can tween the volume of any MovieClip using the tween property "volume", like:
	  TweenLite.to(myClip_mc, 1.5, {volume:0});
	- You can tween the color of a MovieClip using the tween property "tint", like:
	  TweenLite.to(myClip_mc, 1.5, {tint:0xFF0000});
	- To tween an array, just pass in an array as a property named endArray like:
	  var myArray:Array = [1,2,3,4];
	  TweenLite.to(myArray, 1.5, {endArray:[10,20,30,40]});
	- You can kill all tweens for a particular object (usually a MovieClip) anytime with the 
	  TweenLite.killTweensOf(myClip_mc); function. If you want to have the tweens forced to completion, 
	  pass true as the second parameter, like TweenLite.killTweensOf(myClip_mc, true);
	- You can kill all delayedCalls to a particular function using TweenLite.killDelayedCallsTo(myFunction_func);
	  This can be helpful if you want to preempt a call.
	- Use the TweenLite.from() method to animate things into place. For example, if you have things set up on 
	  the stage in the spot where they should end up, and you just want to animate them into place, you can 
	  pass in the beginning x and/or y and/or alpha (or whatever properties you want).
	  
	  
CHANGE LOG:
	9.3:
		- Added compatibility with TweenProxy and TweenProxy3D
	9.291:
		- Adjusted how the timeScale special property is handled internally. It should be more flexible and slightly faster now.
	9.29:
		- Minor speed enhancement
	9.26:
		- Speed improvement and slight file size decrease
	9.25:
		- Fixed bug with autoAlpha tweens working with TweenGroups when they're reversed.
	9.22:
		- Fixed bug with from() when used in a TweenGroup
	9.12:
		- Fixed but with TweenLiteVars, TweenFilterVars, and TweenMaxVars that caused "visible" to always get set at the end of a tween
	9.1:
		- In AUTO or CONCURRENT mode, OverwriteManager doesn't handle overwriting until the tween actually begins which allows for immediate pause()-ing or re-ordering in TweenGroup, etc.
		- Re-architected some inner-workings to further optimize for speed and reduce file size
	9.05:
		- Fixed bug with killTweensOf()
		- Fixed bug with from()
		- Fixed bug with timeScale
	9.0:
		- Made compatible with the new TweenGroup class (see http://blog.greensock.com/tweengroup/ for details) which allows for sequencing and much more
		- Added clear() method
		- Added a "clear" parameter to the removeTween() method
		- Exposed TweenLite.currentTime as well as several other variables for compatibility with TweenGroup
	8.16:
		- Fixed bug that prevented using another tween to gradually change the timeScale of a tween
	8.15:
		- Fixed bug that caused from() delays not to function since version 8.14
	8.14:
		- Fixed bug in managing overwrites
	8.11:
		- Added the ability to overwrite only individual overlapping properties with the new OverwriteManager class
		- Added the killVars() method
		- Fixed potential garbage collection issue
	7.04:
		- Speed optimizations
	7.02:
		- Added ability to tween the volume of any object that has a soundTransform property instead of just MoveiClips and SoundChannels. Now NetStream volumes can be tweened too.
	7.01:
		- Fixed delayedCall() error (removed onCompleteScope since it's not useful in AS3 anyway)
	7.0:
		- Added "persist" special property
		- Added "removeTint" special property (please use this instead of tint:null)
		- Added compatibility with TweenLiteVars utility class
	6.3:
		- Added "visible" special property
	6.24:
		- Very minor change in the complete() function that helps prevent duplicate error reports in onComplete calls.
	6.23:
		- Minor speed improvements and size reduction
	6.22:
		- Removed property validation in the initTweenVals() method because Flash Player 10's Object.hasOwnProperty() incorrectly reports that DisplayObjects don't have a "z" property (same for rotationX, rotationY, and rotationZ I believe) At least in the Beta version that's out as of 5/23/08
	6.21:
		- Fixed bug with complete() not working properly in certain scenarios.
	6.2:
		- Enhanced speed and changed the "tweens" property from an Object to an Array
	6.13:
		- Fixed potential problem with the complete() method that could prevent a tween from completing properly.
	6.11:
		- Fixed issue that prevented tweening to a tint of 0 (black)
	6.1:
		- Ensured that even thousands of tweens are synced (uses an internally-controlled timer)
		- Removed support for mcColor (in favor of "tint")
	6.04:
		- Fixed bug that caused calls to complete() to not render if the tween hadn't ever started (like if there was a delay that hadn't expired yet)
	6.03:
		- Added the "renderOnStart" property that can force TweenLite.from() to render only when the tween actually starts (by default, it renders immediately even if the tween has a delay.)
	6.02:
		- Fixed bug that could cause TweenLite.delayedCall() to generate a 1010 error.
	6.01:
		- Fixed bug that could cause TweenLite.from() to not render the values immediately.
		- Fixed bug that could prevent tweens with a duration of zero from rendering properly.
	6.0:
		- Added ability to tween a MovieClip's frame
		- Added onCompleteScope, onStartScope, and onUpdateScope
		- Reworked internal class routines for handling SubTweens
