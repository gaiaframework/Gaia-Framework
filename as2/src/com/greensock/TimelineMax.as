/**
 * 	TimelineMax extends TimelineLite, offering exactly the same functionality plus useful 
 *  (but non-essential) features like repeat, repeatDelay, yoyo, 
 *  currentLabel, addCallback(), removeCallback(), tweenTo(), getLabelAfter(), getLabelBefore(),
 * 	and getActive() (and probably more in the future). It is the ultimate sequencing tool. 
 *  Think of a TimelineMax instance like a virtual MovieClip timeline or a container where 
 *  you place tweens (or other timelines) over the course of time. You can:
 * 	
 * <ul>
 * 		<li> build sequences easily by adding tweens with the append(), prepend(), insert(), and insertMultiple() methods.</li>
 * 
 * 		<li> add labels, play(), stop(), gotoAndPlay(), gotoAndStop(), restart(), and even reverse()! </li>
 * 		
 * 		<li> nest timelines within timelines as deeply as you want. When you pause or change the 
 * 		  timeScale of a parent timeline, it affects all of its descendents.</li>
 * 		
 * 		<li> set the progress of the timeline using its <code>currentProgress</code> property. For example, to skip to
 * 		  the halfway point, set <code>myTimeline.currentProgress = 0.5</code>.</li>
 * 		  
 * 		<li> tween the <code>currentTime</code>, or <code>currentProgress</code> property to fastforward/rewind the timeline. You could 
 * 		  even attach a slider to one of these properties to give the user the ability to drag 
 * 		  forwards/backwards through the whole timeline.</li>
 * 		  
 * 		<li> add onStart, onUpdate, onComplete, onReverseComplete, and/or onRepeat callbacks using the 
 * 		  constructor's <code>vars</code> object.</li>
 * 		
 * 		<li> speed up or slow down the entire timeline with its timeScale property. You can even tween
 * 		  this property to gradually speed up or slow down the timeline.</li>
 * 		  
 * 		<li> use the insertMultiple() method to create complex sequences including various alignment
 * 		  modes and staggering capabilities.</li>
 * 		  
 * 		<li> base the timing on frames instead of seconds if you prefer. Please note, however, that
 * 		  the timeline's timing mode dictates its childrens' timing mode as well. </li>
 * 		
 * 		<li> kill the tweens of a particular object with killTweensOf() or get the tweens of an object
 * 		  with getTweensOf() or get all the tweens/timelines in the timeline with getChildren()</li>
 * 		  
 * 		<li> set the timeline to repeat any number of times or indefinitely. You can even set a delay
 * 		  between each repeat cycle and/or cause the repeat cycles to yoyo, appearing to reverse
 * 		  every other cycle. </li>
 * 		
 * 		<li> get the active tweens in the timeline with getActive().</li>
 * 
 * 		<li> add callbacks anywhere in the timeline that call a function of your choosing when 
 * 			the "virtual playhead" passes a particular spot.</li>
 * 	</ul>
 * 	
 * <b>EXAMPLE:</b><br /><br /><code>
 * 		
 * 		import com.greensock.TweenLite;<br />
 * 		import com.greensock.TimelineMax;<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//create the timeline<br />
 * 		var myTimeline:TimelineMax = new TimelineMax();<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//add a tween<br />
 * 		myTimeline.append(new TweenLite(mc, 1, {_x:200, _y:100}));<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//add another tween at the end of the timeline (makes sequencing easy)<br />
 * 		myTimeline.append(new TweenLite(mc, 0.5, {_alpha:0}));<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//repeat the whole timeline twice.<br />
 * 		myTimeline.repeat = 2;<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//delay the repeat by 0.5 seconds each time.<br />
 * 		myTimeline.repeatDelay = 0.5;<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//stop/pause the timeline.<br />
 * 		myTimeline.stop();<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//reverse it anytime...<br />
 * 		myTimeline.reverse();<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//Add a "spin" label 3-seconds into the timeline.<br />
 * 		myTimeline.addLabel("spin", 3);<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//insert a rotation tween at the "spin" label (you could also define the insert point as the time instead of a label)<br />
 * 		myTimeline.insert(new TweenLite(mc, 2, {_rotation:"360"}), "spin"); <br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//go to the "spin" label and play the timeline from there...<br />
 * 		myTimeline.gotoAndPlay("spin");<br /><br />
 * 	
 * 		//call myFunction when the "virtual playhead" travels past the 1.5-second point.
 * 		myTimeline.addCallback(myFunction, 1.5);
 * 	
 * 		//add a tween to the beginning of the timeline, pushing all the other existing tweens back in time<br />
 * 		myTimeline.prepend(new TweenLite(mc, 1, {tint:0xFF0000}));<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//nest another TimelineMax inside your timeline...<br />
 * 		var nestedTimeline:TimelineMax = new TimelineMax();<br />
 * 		nestedTimeline.append(new TweenLite(mc2, 1, {_x:200}));<br />
 * 		myTimeline.append(nestedTimeline);<br /><br /></code>
 * 		
 * 		
 * 	insertMultiple() provides some very powerful sequencing tools as well, allowing you to add an Array of 
 * 	tweens/timelines and optionally align them with SEQUENCE or START modes, and even stagger them if you want. For example, to insert
 * 	3 tweens into the timeline, aligning their start times but staggering them by 0.2 seconds, <br /><br /><code>
 * 	
 * 		myTimeline.insertMultiple([new TweenLite(mc, 1, {_y:"100"}),
 * 								   new TweenLite(mc2, 1, {_y:"120"}),
 * 								   new TweenLite(mc3, 1, {_y:"140"})], 
 * 								   0, 
 * 								   TweenAlign.START, 
 * 								   0.2);</code><br /><br />
 * 								   
 * 	You can use the constructor's "vars" object to do all the setup too, like:<br /><br /><code>
 * 	
 * 		var myTimeline:TimelineMax = new TimelineMax({tweens:[new TweenLite(mc1, 1, {_y:"100"}), TweenMax.to(mc2, 1, {tint:0xFF0000})], align:TweenAlign.SEQUENCE, onComplete:myFunction, repeat:2, repeatDelay:1});</code><br /><br />
 * 	
 * 	If that confuses you, don't worry. Just use the append(), insert(), and prepend() methods to build your
 * 	sequence. But power users will likely appreciate the quick, compact way they can set up sequences now. <br /><br />
 * 
 *
 * <b>NOTES:</b>
 * <ul>
 * 	<li> TimelineMax automatically inits the OverwriteManager class to prevent unexpected overwriting behavior in sequences.
 * 	  The default mode is AUTO, but you can set it to whatever you want with OverwriteManager.init() (see http://www.greensock.com/overwritemanager/)</li>
 * 	<li> TimelineMax adds about 4.2k to your SWF including OverwriteManager.</li>

		/**
		 * Constructor <br /><br />
		 * 
		 * <b>SPECIAL PROPERTIES</b><br />
		 * The following special properties may be passed in via the constructor's vars parameter, like
		 * <code>new TimelineMax({paused:true, onComplete:myFunction, repeat:2, yoyo:true})</code> 
		 * 
		 * <ul>
		 * 	<li><b> delay : Number</b>				Amount of delay before the timeline should begin (in seconds unless "useFrames" is set 
		 * 											to true in which case the value is measured in frames).</li>
		 * 								
		 * 	<li><b> useFrames : Boolean</b>			If useFrames is set to true, the timeline's timing mode will be based on frames. 
		 * 											Otherwise, it will be based on seconds/time. NOTE: a TimelineLite's timing mode is 
		 * 											always determined by its parent timeline. </li>
		 * 
		 *  <li><b> paused : Boolean</b> 			Sets the initial paused state of the timeline (by default, timelines automatically begin playing immediately)</li>
		 * 
		 * 	<li><b> reversed : Boolean</b>			If true, the timeline will be reversed initially. This does NOT force it to the very end and start 
		 * 											playing backwards. It simply affects the orientation of the timeline, so if reversed is set to 
		 * 											true initially, it will appear not to play because it is already at the beginning. To cause it to
		 * 											play backwards from the end, set reversed to true and then set the <code>currentProgress</code> property to 1 immediately
		 * 											after creating the timeline.</li>
		 * 									
		 * 	<li><b> tweens : Array</b>				To immediately insert several tweens into the timeline, use the "tweens" special property
		 * 											to pass in an Array of TweenLite/TweenMax/TimelineLite/TimelineMax instances. You can use this in conjunction
		 * 											with the align and stagger special properties to set up complex sequences with minimal code.
		 * 											These values simply get passed to the insertMultiple() method.</li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> align : String</b>				Only used in conjunction with the "tweens" special property when multiple tweens are
		 * 											to be inserted immediately. The value simply gets passed to the 
		 * 											insertMultiple() method. Default is NORMAL. Options are:
		 * 											<ul>
		 * 												<li><b> TweenAlign.SEQUENCE:</b> aligns the tweens one-after-the-other in a sequence</li>
		 * 												<li><b> TweenAlign.START:</b> aligns the start times of all of the tweens (ignores delays)</li>
		 * 												<li><b> TweenAlign.NORMAL:</b> aligns the start times of all the tweens (honors delays)</li>
		 * 											</ul></li>
		 * 										
		 * 	<li><b> stagger : Number</b>			Only used in conjunction with the "tweens" special property when multiple tweens are
		 * 											to be inserted immediately. It staggers the tweens by a set amount of time (in seconds) (or
		 * 											in frames if "useFrames" is true). For example, if the stagger value is 0.5 and the "align" 
		 * 											property is set to TweenAlign.START, the second tween will start 0.5 seconds after the first one 
		 * 											starts, then 0.5 seconds later the third one will start, etc. If the align property is 
		 * 											TweenAlign.SEQUENCE, there would be 0.5 seconds added between each tween. This value simply gets 
		 * 											passed to the insertMultiple() method. Default is 0.</li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> onStart : Function</b>			A function that should be called when the timeline begins (the <code>currentProgress</code> won't necessarily
		 * 											be zero when onStart is called. For example, if the timeline is created and then its <code>currentProgress</code>
		 * 											property is immediately set to 0.5 or if its <code>currentTime</code> property is set to something other than zero,
		 * 											onStart will still get fired because it is the first time the timeline is getting rendered.)</li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> onStartParams : Array</b>		An Array of parameters to pass the onStart function.</li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> onStartScope: Object</b>		Defines the scope of the onStart function (what "this" refers to inside that function).</li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> onUpdate : Function</b>			A function that should be called every time the timeline's time/position is updated 
		 * 											(on every frame while the timeline is active)</li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> onUpdateParams : Array</b>		An Array of parameters to pass the onUpdate function</li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> onUpdateScope: Object</b>		Defines the scope of the onUpdate function (what "this" refers to inside that function).</li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> onComplete : Function</b>		A function that should be called when the timeline has finished </li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> onCompleteParams : Array</b>	An Array of parameters to pass the onComplete function</li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> onCompleteScope: Object</b>		Defines the scope of the onComplete function (what "this" refers to inside that function).</li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> onReverseComplete : Function</b> A function that should be called when the timeline has reached its starting point again after having been reversed </li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> onReverseCompleteParams : Array</b> An Array of parameters to pass the onReverseComplete functions</li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> onReverseCompleteScope: Object</b>	Defines the scope of the onReverseComplete function (what "this" refers to inside that function).</li>
		 *  
		 * 	<li><b> onRepeat : Function</b>			A function that should be called every time the timeline repeats </li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> onRepeatParams : Array</b>		An Array of parameters to pass the onRepeat function</li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> onRepeatScope: Object</b>		Defines the scope of the onRepeat function (what "this" refers to inside that function).</li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> autoRemoveChildren : Boolean</b> If autoRemoveChildren is set to true, as soon as child tweens/timelines complete,
		 * 											they will automatically get killed/removed. This is normally undesireable because
		 * 											it prevents going backwards in time (like if you want to reverse() or set the 
		 * 											<code>currentProgress</code> value to a lower value, etc.). It can, however, improve speed and memory
		 * 											management. TweenLite's root timelines use <code>autoRemoveChildren:true.</code></li>
		 * 
		 * 	<li><b> repeat : Number</b>				Number of times that the timeline should repeat. To repeat infinitely, use -1.</li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> repeatDelay : Number</b>		Amount of time in seconds (or frames for frames-based timelines) between repeats.</li>
		 * 	
		 * 	<li><b> yoyo : Boolean</b> 				Works in conjunction with the repeat property, determining the behavior of each 
		 * 											cycle. When yoyo is true, the timeline will go back and forth, appearing to reverse 
		 * 											every other cycle (this has no affect on the <code>reversed</code> property though). So if repeat is
		 * 											2 and yoyo is false, it will look like: start - 1 - 2 - 3 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 1 - 2 - 3 - end. But 
		 * 											if repeat is 2 and yoyo is true, it will look like: start - 1 - 2 - 3 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 1 - 2 - 3 - end. </li>
		 * 	</ul>
		 * 
		 * @param vars optionally pass in special properties like useFrames, onComplete, onCompleteParams, onUpdate, onUpdateParams, onStart, onStartParams, tweens, align, stagger, delay, autoRemoveChildren, onCompleteListener, onStartListener, onUpdateListener, repeat, repeatDelay, and/or yoyo.

		 * Creates a linear tween that essentially scrubs the playhead to a particular time or label and then stops. For

		 * 
		 * myTimeline.tweenTo("myLabel2"); <br /><br /></code>
		 * 
		 * If you want advanced control over the tween, like adding an onComplete or changing the ease or adding a delay, 
		 * just pass in a vars object with the appropriate properties. For example, to tween to the 5-second point on the 
		 * timeline and then call a function named <code>myFunction</code> and pass in a parameter that's references this 
		 * TimelineMax and use a Strong.easeOut ease, you'd do: <br /><br /><code>
		 * 
		 * myTimeline.tweenTo(5, {onComplete:myFunction, onCompleteParams:[myTimeline], ease:Strong.easeOut});<br /><br /></code>
		 * 
		 * Remember, this method simply creates a TweenLite instance that tweens the <code>currentTime</code> property of your timeline. 
		 * So you can store a reference to that tween if you want, and you can kill() it anytime. Also note that <code>tweenTo()</code>
		 * does <b>NOT</b> affect the timeline's <code>reversed</code> property. So if your timeline is oriented normally

		 * but the <code>reversed</code> property will <b>not</b> change to <code>true</code>. Also note that <code>tweenTo()</code>
		 * pauses the timeline immediately before tweening its <code>currentTime</code> property, and it stays paused after the tween completes.
		 * If you need to resume playback, you could always use an onComplete to call the <code>resume()</code> method.<br /><br />
		 * 
		 * If you plan to sequence multiple playhead tweens one-after-the-other, it is typically better to use 
		 * <code>tweenFromTo()</code> so that you can define the starting point and ending point, allowing the 
		 * duration to be accurately determined immediately. 
		 *
